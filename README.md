# DSA_Tracker

This project tracks my personal progress through Alex Xu's Coding Interview Patterns problems.

The goal is to:
- Work through data structures and algorithms in a structured way
- Maintain a record of solved problems and solutions
- Build a real application with a backend API and frontend UI

## Current State

- Project structure initialized
- Docker Compose infrastructure set up
- Postgres database runs locally via Docker
- No application code implemented yet

## Repo Structure
-`api/` - Backend API (Planned)
-`data/` - Problem metadata and structure (JSON Initially)
-`docker/` - Local development infrastructure (Docker Compose)
-`scripts/` - Helper scripts and tooling
-`solutions/` - Solution code for problems
-`web/` - Frontend UI (Planned)

## Infrastructure

Local infrastructure is managed with Docker Compose.

See `docker/README.md` for details on:
- environment setup
- starting/stopping the database
- data persistence

## Notes

This project is currently in early setup and planning stages.
